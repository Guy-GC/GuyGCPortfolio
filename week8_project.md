# Introduction

This entry will go over the issue that I worked on in our GitHub repository, talking about the
process, creating the pull request with an assignee, and then issues that I faced reviewing
a team member's code in the repository.

# Issue For This Week

I decided to assign myself the following task: "As an UNDAC Deputy Team Leader I want to create
and manage a calendar of events so that I can coordinate the work of the operational sub-teams."
The task requires me to make a calendar that can show meetings/events if I click on a specified day; and be able to add, edit, and delete meetings/events.

I believe that I have used multiple different software design principles within my
code using the KISS, DRY, useful comments, good function naming, and even the use of
whitespace. For the useful comments, I used only two comments meaning that I don't
over-comment nor make comments that just state the obvious. The first comment is used to
show further improvements later down the line which in this case is to create a spreadsheet
with all the event data so it can be saved and then accessed later on. I have kept the code
overall pretty simple, adding variables to the meetings list, and creating event handlers so
I can create 







In week 8, you are exercising all the principles and techniques that have been discussed 
in the module so far. Your portfolio entry should demonstrate your ability to integrate 
the various dimensions of software engineering into your practice. It should include 

* A descriptive summary of the issue that you worked on.
* Snippets from your code with commentary showing how you have used good software design 
  practice.
* A descriptive summary of the test code that you have written.
* A reflective summary of any changes that were requested during the code review along 
  with your fixes.
* A descriptive summary of any issues you found with the code that you were asked to review.
* A general reflective section that identifies, for example,
  * New things you have realised this week
  * Common problems that can arise in a team development situation
  * How your practice compares to other people's
  * etc.

Be sure to include links to the original items in the team's GitHub repository.
