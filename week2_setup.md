# Introduction

This entry will go over the setup of our group Github repository, and go into detail 
about some of the challenges involved when creating our development environment.

# The Creation of the GitHub Repository

We were given the task by our lecturers of creating a GitHub repository with all the team 
members involved in the group project, creating an integrated taskboard in GitHub, cloning
the shared repository on Visual Studio, and making sure Visual Studio is properly configured 
(installing the .NET MAUI template). To stay in touch with the group members, delegate tasks,
or even ask for help on how to use GitHub we made a discord server with all the members. We 
then made the GitHub repository naming it after our team name given to us, Green Team. We 
created a task board within the GitHub repository by going to the projects tab and clicking
'new project'. When we created the project board we made 3 columns on the board which are:
todo, In Progress, and Done. We then put the 4 tasks given to us on the task board in the
In Progress column. Next, we configured our Visual Studio correctly with some people having
to install Visual Studio, some having to install the .NET MAUI template, and some having
their Visual Studio already configured correctly. We then cloned the repository by copying
the URL from GitHub into Visual Studio. Once every task given to us was finished we put all 
the tasks on the task board in the 'Done' column.

# Reflection

There are a couple of things that as a group, or the configuration of our GitHub repository
we could have done differently. There are also some possible limitations to our configuration.

## Experience

GitHub is a difficult tool to learn for beginners because of the amount of things the user can 
do and this can make the new user confused and a bit overwhelmed. I think this could impact the
group at the start of the project however, I think over time more people will understand the website
and maybe use it more even after the project is finished.

## Github

One alternative to the configuration we have is using a different website other than GitHub.
There are different sites that offer close to the same as Github albeit maybe less popular,
like Gitlab or BitBucket. This would mean that everyone in the group could be learning how
to use the other website rather than some people having lots of experience using GitHub and
some who haven't used it at all.

## Visual Studio

I think Visual Studio is the correct choice for our configuration. Last year, we used Intellij
when we used GitHub because we were using Java for the coding part of the assignment. For this
module, we are going to be using C# which is probably best if we use Visual Studio to clone the
GitHub Repository.








# Setup

This section documents your practical work in week 2.

The main requirements are to show that:

1. Your development environment is correctly set up
2. You understand the setup including potential alternative configuration settings

## Environment configuration

Here, you should include appropriate screenshots with additional commentary. 

**DO**

* Place your image files in the `images` folder
* Choose your screenshots carefully so that they communicate the appropriate information.
  Many screenshots with no clear purpose or with trivial differences are of little value.
* Provide <ins>descriptive</ins> commentary to explain why the screenshot is included. 
  what it shows and point out any particularly significant details.
* Modify your screenshots - for example, by adding arrows, outlines or other highlighting 
  techniques - to enhance their communication value.
* Remove unnecessary material from your screenshots such as toolbars, other windows and 
  computer desktop to eliminate distractions.
* Ensure that any important content is clearly legible. Pay particular attention to text
  size and image resolution.
* Use [numbered captions](https://towardsdev.com/3-ways-to-add-a-caption-to-an-image-using-markdown-f2ca30562be6) 
  as labels for images. Also, use the caption numbers to refer to images in your text.

**DON'T**

* Expect the reader to understand your reasons for including a screenshot. If you can't
  explain it, the screenshot will not do the job on its own.
* Include self-evident comments. For example, don't simply list the values used on a
  configuration page if those values are clearly visible in the screenshot.

## Reflection

For this section, decide what points are worth making and structure your content 
appropriately.

**DO**

* Use sub-headings to differentiate between sections
* Provide <ins>reflective</ins> commentary that discusses, for example, limitations of
  your current configuration, how your configuration is appropriate for the current 
  project, alternative configuration that might be appropriate in ther circumstances, 
  etc.
* Mention any difficulties you had setting up your working environment and how you 
  resolved them

**DON'T**

* Repeat the descriptive commentary from point 1
* Give a blow-by-blow account of everything you did. Instead, you should highlight 
  the important points.
