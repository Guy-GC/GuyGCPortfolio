# Introduction

This entry will go over the testing we did on a new repository we created to compete against
another group. I will summarise the purpose of the code and show the test code, I will also
show the test code and explain the purpose, reason, and any limitations of the test.

# The New Repository

We were given a new repository to work on this week for the test battles. The repository is a
hangman app that has all the functions created but just needs the code to be implemented.
Once the code has been created then we would create the unit test for the function we made.
I worked on a function with someone else as there were only a couple of functions to work on
and the other person was having issues with the university computer and didn't have a laptop
on him so I suggested for him to work with me.

I chose to do the function within our repository called CheckLetterInWord. The purpose of
this function is to check if the word in the game Hangman contains a letter that the
user provides. So if the word is apple and the user guesses 'A' then the function would
return true, if the user guesses 'Z' the function would return false. We chose to do
two tests to make sure the function returns the correct boolean answer (so one test for
true and one test for false).

# Test Code









The practical exercise in week 6 involved competitive testing. For your portfolio entry,
select two pieces of test code that you wrote that best illustrate your skills in this area.
If you were working with someone else - for example, while using pair programming - 
Make sure that is clear in your discussion.

For each example

Include the test code
Provide a brief explanation of the test(s) that are performed
Explain why this is an important aspect of the code to test
Identify any limitations of your tests (this may be something that you realised after the evaluation).
Did you manage to write a test which failed during the final evaluation? If so, that would make an excellent example. You should briefly discuss why the writer of the code might have overlooked the particular test case that failed.
