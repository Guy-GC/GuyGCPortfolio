# Introduction

This entry will go over the workflow tools in GitHub, assigning a task from the issue list, and branching from the main 
to complete the issue then create a pull request.

# Workflow

We were given the task this week to decide on a standard team workflow that we should follow as a group when we work on
a GitHub issue, import the list of issues appointed to us into our group project, assign an issue to each person in
the group and complete it with the team workflow. Our standard team workflow is to create a branch to make changes to a
file or multiple files and then create a pull request to make sure everything is correct if any errors arise then the
changes can be reviewed and then the changes can be merged into the main branch. When we established the team workflow
we imported the list of issues into our group project, each issue is similar to the other, and the issues are formatted
like 'As a system administrator, I want to maintain reference values for (blank)'. Some examples are 'equipment types',
'continents', 'system types' etc. The goal for each issue is to be able to print the values out. Once the issues are
imported, an issue is then assigned to a person within the group and is moved from the to-do column in the task board to
the in-progress column. I then created changes within our repository in a branch that I created for me to fix the issue 
within and then once I created the solution I then made a pull request to later be merged into the main branch.

# Reflection

There are a few things looking back that I or the group could have done differently. Here are some changes looking back
that I would have done differently.

## Assigning Issues

One problem we ran into was that people were struggling to assign the issue and put the issue in the in-progress column.
This is because most people within the group aren't admins for the GitHub repository meaning they don't have permission
to move the tasks themselves, they need an admin to do it for them. What we could have done is if the admin of the
repository gave admin access to all the members of the group this wouldn't be an issue. However, there could be problems
if every member has admin access, if someone changes the repository it could lead to a lot of work to fix the issue.
If there is more than one admin it means that it doesn't rely on one person to change the issue to a different column.

## Main Branch

One problem we faced was that some people were working in the main branch and it took a long time to fix the main branch
template. An easy resolution is just to make sure everyone in the group is made aware to not change anything in the main
branch when making changes, some people might not know as they don't have a lot of experience with GitHub or it could of
been a mistake.





















# Workflow

This section documents your practical work in week 3.

The main requirements are to show that:

1. You know how to use the workflow tools in GitHub
2. You have successfully carried out the required operations which are:
   * Accept a task from the project backlog
   * Update the task information appropriately
   * Update the task board appropriately
   * Complete the development task on a feature branch
   * Commit your changes with appropriate comments
   * Check your work against the Definition of Done (DoD)
   * Make a pull request

## Task workflow

Here, you should use screenshots and descriptive commentary to show that the required
have been completed successfully.

**DO**

* Consider the layout of your content from the point of view of the reader. Many raw
  screenshots will take up a lot of space. It may be better to adopt a different strategy
  such as
  * Using thumbnails with links to full-size images
  * Combining two or more screenshots into a single image 
  * Using partial screenshots to highlight only the important information
  * etc.
* Provide links to the actual objects (e.g. task, pull request, etc.) in the team project
  in GitHub
* Read through your work to make sure that the information comes across clearly

**DON'T**

* Use humour or informal language
* Waste space with trivial or self-evident commentary
* Abbreviate your commentary using (e.g. by using bullet points). Your text should be in
  the form of grammatically correct sentences.

## Reflection

Here, you should highlight any difficulties that you faced in completing the task, and
how you resolved them.

You should also briefly discuss the current process and how it could be refined or
improved in future iterations. For example, is the DoD adequate or too onerous? Is the
current procedure for updating the task appropriate? Is the task board configured to
work in an intuitive way?
