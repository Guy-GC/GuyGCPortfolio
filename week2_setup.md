# Introduction

This entry will go over the setup of our group Github repository, and go into detail 
about some of the challenges involved when creating our development environment.

# The Creation of the GitHub Repository

We were given the task by our lecturers of creating a GitHub repository with all the team 
members involved in the group project, creating an integrated taskboard in GitHub, cloning
the shared repository on Visual Studio, and making sure Visual Studio is properly configured 
(installing the .NET MAUI template). To stay in touch with the group members, delegate tasks,
or even ask for help on how to use GitHub we made a discord server with all the members. We 
then made the GitHub repository naming it after our team name given to us, Green Team. We 
created a task board within the GitHub repository by going to the projects tab and clicking
'new project'. When we created the project board we made 3 columns on the board which are:
todo, In Progress, and Done. We then put the 4 tasks given to us on the task board in the
In Progress column. Next, we configured our Visual Studio correctly with some people having
to install Visual Studio, some having to install the .NET MAUI template, and some having
their Visual Studio already configured correctly. We then cloned the repository by copying
the URL from GitHub into Visual Studio. Once every task given to us was finished we put all 
the tasks on the task board in the 'Done' column.

This screenshot shows our project board in our shared repository. We can see the three
columns: todo, in progress, and done. All of the tasks given to us have been put in the
done column.

This screenshot shows the templates installed for Visual Studio. As you can see by the highlighted
template I have installed the .NET MAUI template as tasked to us by our lecturers.



# Reflection

There are a couple of things that as a group, or the configuration of our GitHub repository
we could have done differently. There are also some possible limitations to our configuration.

## Experience

GitHub is a difficult tool to learn for beginners because of the amount of things the user can 
do and this can make the new user confused and a bit overwhelmed. I think this could impact the
group at the start of the project however, I think over time more people will understand the website
and maybe use it more even after the project is finished.

## Github

One alternative to the configuration we have is using a different website other than GitHub.
There are different sites that offer close to the same as Github albeit maybe less popular,
like Gitlab or BitBucket. This would mean that everyone in the group could be learning how
to use the other website rather than some people having lots of experience using GitHub and
some who haven't used it at all.

## Visual Studio

I think Visual Studio is the correct choice for our configuration. Last year, we used Intellij
when we used GitHub because we were using Java for the coding part of the assignment. For this
module, we are going to be using C# which is probably best if we use Visual Studio to clone the
GitHub Repository.

\
I did have one issue that took some time to resolve which was installing the .NET MAUI template.
I already had Visual Studio installed on my laptop but the template wasn't installed. I tried using
powershell but had problems going to the correct directory. I eventually got it installed, I had
go into Visual Studio installer and modify the package. The Visual Studio configuration
[screenshot](https://github.com/Guy-GC/GuyGCPortfolio/blob/main/images/VisualConfig.png) is where i modified the package.
