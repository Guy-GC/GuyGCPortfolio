# Introduction
This entry will go over six rules of clean code, I will summarise each rule, provide an example, and
explain how my example implements the rule. I will also show my doxygen comments from the GitHub
repository, provide some commentary on the comments, and show some examples where I get rid of the
comments to stick with the principles of clean codes.

# Rules of Clean Code

There are many rules of clean code, here are six examples of clean code:

## Meaningful Names

Names are everywhere within software, naming functions, variables, classes etc. Giving names a
meaningful name makes your code easier to read and makes the functions, variables etc. more searchable
within your codespace.

## Functions

Functions should be kept small, simple; be given a good (and meaningful) name; and should do
only one thing. The reason why you should follow this clean code principle. This will make your 
functions very clear and precise allowing any programmer to understand a function very quickly.

## Comments

Comments are used to compensate for our attempt to express our code clearly. Comments should
be used on code that can be difficult to understand, however, you should consider rewriting the 
code instead to make it more inspired. It is good for your comment to explain why your code is
doing something rather than what it is doing.

## Objects and Data Structures

## Formatting

## DRY

As mentioned last entry, DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) is a principle to avoid duplicating code.
Duplicated code can lead to inconsistencies 






# Documentation

This section is related to your work on clean code and documentation in week 5.

First, choose six rules of clean code and explain them. For each one,

* Summarise the rule in your own words.
* Provide an example from the code that you wrote in week 2 and then refined in week 4.
* Explain how your code implements the rule. 

Second, copy the doxygen comments from your code into your portfolio and provide some 
descriptive commentary on their purpose and structure. Use screenshots showing the HTML 
content that is generated from your code to illustrate your explanation.

Finally, highlight three examples from your code where you have eliminated the need
for comments by adhering to the principles of clean code.
